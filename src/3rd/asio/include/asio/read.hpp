/// Start an asynchronous operation to read a certain amount of data from a

/**
 * This function is used to asynchronously read a certain number of bytes of
 * data from a stream. The function call always returns immediately. The
 * asynchronous operation will continue until one of the following conditions is
 * true:
 *
 * @li The supplied buffers are full. That is, the bytes transferred is equal to
 * the sum of the buffer sizes.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
 * async_read_some function, and is known as a <em>composed operation</em>. The
 * program must ensure that the stream performs no other read operations (such
 * as async_read, the stream's async_read_some function, or any other composed
 * operations that perform reads) until this operation completes.
 *
 * @param s The stream from which the data is to be read. The type must support
 * the AsyncReadStream concept.
 *
 * @param buffers One or more buffers into which the data will be read. The sum
 * of the buffer sizes indicates the maximum number of bytes to read from the
 * stream. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of
 * the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee
 * that they remain valid until the handler is called.
 *
 * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
 * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the
 * handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
 *
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes copied into the
 *                                           // buffers. If an error occurred,
 *                                           // this will be the  number of
 *                                           // bytes successfully transferred
 *                                           // prior to the error.
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of
 * the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
 * asio::io_service::post().
 *
 * @par Example
 * To read into a single data buffer use the @ref buffer function as follows:
 * @code
 * asio::async_read(s, asio::buffer(data, size), handler);
 * @endcode
 * See the @ref buffer documentation for information on reading into multiple
 * buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or
 * std::vector.
 *
 * @note This overload is equivalent to calling:
 * @code asio::async_read(
 *     s, buffers,
 *     asio::transfer_all(),
 *     handler); @endcode
